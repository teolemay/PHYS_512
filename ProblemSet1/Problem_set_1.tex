Given a function $f$, evaluated at the points $x\pm\delta$ and $x\pm2\delta$.

\subsection{a)}
The derivative at $x$ can be calculated from the points around $x$ using the central derivative formula (in the limit of small $\delta$):
\[f'(x) = \frac{f(x+\delta) - f(x-\delta)}{2\delta}\]
Performing a Taylor expansion of $f$ at each point gives
\[f(x+\delta) \approx f(x) + f'(x)\delta + \frac{1}{2}f''(x)\delta^2 + \frac{1}{6}f'''(x)\delta^3 + \frac{1}{24}f''''(x)\delta^4 + \frac{1}{120}f'''''(x)\delta^5 + ...\]
\[f(x-\delta) \approx f(x) - f'(x)\delta + \frac{1}{2}f''(x)\delta^2 - \frac{1}{6}f'''(x)\delta^3 + \frac{1}{24}f''''(x)\delta^4 - \frac{1}{120}f'''''(x)\delta^5 + ...\]
\[f(x+2\delta) \approx f(x) + f'(x)2\delta + 2f''(x)\delta^2 + \frac{4}{3}f'''(x)\delta^3 + \frac{2}{3}f''''(x)\delta^4 + \frac{4}{15}f'''''(x)\delta^5 + ...\]
\[f(x-2\delta) \approx f(x) - f'(x)2\delta + 2f''(x)\delta^2 - \frac{4}{3}f'''(x)\delta^3 + \frac{2}{3}f''''(x)\delta^4 - \frac{4}{15}f'''''(x)\delta^5 + ...\]
For the $x\pm\delta$ case, subtracting $f(x-\delta)$ from $f(x+\delta)$ gives the central derivative:
\[f(x+\delta) - f(x-\delta) = 2f'(x)\delta +\frac{1}{3}f'''(x)\delta^3 + \frac{1}{60}f'''''(x)\delta^5 + ...\]
\[f'(x) = \frac{f(x+\delta) - f(x-\delta)}{2\delta}-  \frac{1}{6}f'''(x)\delta^2 - \frac{1}{120}f'''''(x)\delta^4 + ... \]
Performing the same operation on the $x\pm2\delta$ case:
\[f'(x) = \frac{f(x+2\delta) - f(x-2\delta)}{4\delta} - \frac{2}{3}f'''(x)\delta^2 - \frac{2}{15}f'''''(x)\delta^4 - ...\]
The $\delta^2$ term can be eliminated by subtracting four times the $x\pm\delta$ derivative from the $x\pm2\delta$ derivative
\begin{multline*}
	f'(x) - 4f'(x) = \left(\frac{f(x+2\delta) - f(x-2\delta)}{4\delta} - \frac{2}{3}f'''(x)\delta^2 - \frac{2}{15}f'''''(x)\delta^4 - ...\right) - \\
	4\left(\frac{f(x+\delta) - f(x-\delta)}{2\delta}-  \frac{1}{6}f'''(x)\delta^2 - \frac{1}{120}f'''''(x)\delta^4 + ...\right)
\end{multline*}
\[-3f'(x) = \frac{8f(x-\delta) + f(x+2\delta) - 8f(x+\delta) - f(x-\delta)}{4\delta} - \frac{1}{10}f'''''(x)\delta^4\]
\[\boxed{ f'(x) = \frac{8f(x+\delta) - 8f(x-\delta) + f(x-\delta) - f(x+2\delta)}{12\delta} + \frac{1}{30}f'''''(x)\delta^4 + ... }\]

\subsection{b)}
The error for this derivative is comes from rounding error and discarding higher order terms from the Taylor series. For rounding error $\epsilon$, the error is approximately 
\[\text{error } = \frac{|f(x)|\cdot\epsilon}{\delta} + \frac{1}{30}f'''''(x)\delta^4 \text{.}\]
Minimizing with respect to $\delta$:
\[0 = \dv{}{\delta}\left( \frac{|f(x)|\cdot\epsilon}{\delta} + \frac{1}{30}f'''''(x)\delta^4 \right) = -\frac{|f(x)|\cdot \epsilon}{\delta^2} + \frac{2}{15}f'''''(x)\delta^3\]
\[\frac{|f(x)|\cdot \epsilon}{\delta^2} = \frac{2}{15}f'''''(x)\delta^3\]
\[\delta^5 = \frac{15}{2}\frac{|f(x)|\cdot \epsilon}{f'''''(x)}\]
So the ideal value of $\delta$ should be 
\[\boxed{ \delta = \left(\frac{15}{2}\frac{|f(x)|\cdot \epsilon}{f'''''(x)}\right)^{1/5} }\text{ .}\]
For $f = e^{x}$, the ideal step should be approximately
\[\delta \approx \left(\frac{15}{2}\frac{e^x}{e^x}\cdot10^{-16}\right)^{1/5} = \left(\frac{15}{2}\cdot10^{-16}\right)^{1/5} =  9.441\cdot10^{-4} \]
As shown in figure 1, the calculated value of $\delta$ performs better than steps sizes of an order of magnitude higher and lower.

\end{figure}
\\
For $f(x) = e^{0.01x}$, the ideal step size should be approximately
\[\delta \approx \left(\frac{15}{2}\frac{e^{0.01x}}{10^{-10}e^{0.01x}}\cdot 10^{-16} \right)^{1/5} = \left(\frac{15}{2} \cdot 10^{-6} \right)^{1/5} = 9.441\cdot 10^{-2} \]
As shown in Figure 2, this is also approximately the correct step size as it outperforms steps sizes of an order of magnitude larger and smaller.

\section{}
For my function, I estimate the ideal derivative step size $dx$ by trying different values of dx and comparing the difference in derivatives calculated for close values of $dx$. Near the best value of $dx$ the error is minimized, so other values around the best value will also have relatively small error compared to $dx$ far from the ideal value. Therefore, I calculate the optimal dx by choosing the value around which there is the least change in the numerical derivative. My complete numerical differentiation function is described below.\\
\\

\textbf{My numerical differentiator function pseudocode:}\\
Finding optimal step size $dx$:
\begin{itemize}
	\item To get around the proper order of magnitude, evaluate the derivative for $dx \in \{10^{-16}, 10^{-15}, 10^{-14}, ..., 10^{-1}, 1 \}$.
	\item Since I expect less variation near the optimal $dx$, evaluate differences of derivatives for adjacent $dx$ values and choose $dx$ corresponding to smallest difference.
	\item Refine the optimal $dx$ guess by repeating the previous steps above with $dx$ from the interval centered around the best guess $\{dx\cdot10^-1, ... dx, ... dx\cdot10\}$. I take the best $dx$ at this point as good enough to proceed.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item For array inputs of $x$ , the derivative is evaluated at all points of $x$ with all values of $dx$. Differences between derivatives for adjacent $dx$ values are calculated, then summed along each value of $x$ to get an array of the differences for each $dx$. The best $dx$ is chosen in the same manner, from the  $dx$ corresponding to the minimum difference.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Evaluating the derivative:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The numerical derivative output is calculated using the central derivative.formula using the chosen best $dx$ at each point in $x$.
\end{itemize}
Estimating Error
\begin{itemize}
	\item Error estimation is calculated according to the formula for the error of the central derivative: $R \approx \frac{f(x)\epsilon}{dx} + \frac{1}{6}f'''(x)dx^2$ where $\epsilon = 10^{-16}$ is the rounding error.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The third derivative for the error formula is crudely calculated at each point of the function:
		\item For each point in $x$, I calculate $f'(x\pm2dx)$ and use these values to get $f''(x+dx) = \frac{f'(x+2dx) - f'(x)}{2dx}$ and $f''(x-dx) = \frac{f'(x) - f'(x-2dx)}{2dx}$. Finally, the value of $f'''(x) = \frac{f''(x+dx) - f''(x-dx)}{2dx}$ is used to evaluate the formula for $R$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
The code for this question is in the file named "Q2\_numerical\_differentiator.py". Testing on the function $f(x) = e^x$ results in actual error of order $10^{-11}$ or lower. The error estimated by the function is within one order of magnitude to the actual error and generally on the same order of magnitude or even closer. Examples of the function output for $e^x$ and $\sin{x}$ in Figure 3.

\section{}
My interpolation function uses the SciPy's cubic spline interpolation implementation (scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline) with natural boundary conditions (second derivative is 0 at the endpoints of the interval). The SciPy implementation takes the given data points as input, and computes a cubic spline for the points with the specified boundary conditions. The output is a SciPy function that computes the spline's corresponding polynomial at any given point within the limits of the input data. (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline.html)\\
\\
My function estimates the error of the cubic spline by comparing it to a cubic polynomial interpolation since the cubic spline is simply a piecewise collection of cubic polynomial interpolations with special conditions on their derivatives that tend to make it a better fit. Therefore, I expect the actual error to be generally less than or equal to that of a simple cubic polynomial interpolation. Assuming that the input data function is 4 times differentiable, the cubic polynomial interpolation's error over 4 points is:
\[f(x) - P_3(x) = \frac{1}{4!}f''''(\xi_x)\prod_{i=1}^{4}(x-x_i)\] 
for some point $\xi_x$ within the interval of the four points \footnote{Stoer, J., and Bulirsch, R. 2002, Introduction to Numerical Analysis, 3rd ed. (New York: Springer), \S 2.1.4.1}. In this case, the fourth derivative is computed by repeatedly using the forward derivative formula using the known first derivatives at the four points around each point of interpolation. For example: if the cubic polynomial interpolation uses the points $\{x_a, x_b, x_c, x_d\}$ and $f'(x)$ is known at all points, then
\[f''(x_b) \approx \frac{f'(x_b) - f'(x_a)}{x_b-x_a}\]
\[f''(x_c) \approx \frac{f'(x_c) - f'(x_b)}{x_c-x_b}\]
\[f''(x_d) \approx \frac{f'(x_d) - f'(x_c)}{x_d-x_c}\]
\[f'''(x_c) \approx \frac{f''(x_c) - f''(x_b)}{x_c-x_b}\]
\[f'''(x_d) \approx \frac{f''(x_d) - f''(x_c)}{x_d-x_c}\]
\[f''''(x_d) \approx \frac{f'''(x_d) - f'''(x_c)}{x_d-x_c}\]
This is a very crude calculation of the fourth derivative and it always uses the fourth derivative at the rightmost point of the interval instead of choosing $\xi_x$ to maximize the error.\\
\\
Figure 4 shows the interpolation over the dataset, as well as the error. The interpolation follows the data very closely, which is consistent with the estimated error being small at most points. There is also a large spike in the magnitude of the estimated error near the sharp "elbow" curve in the data, which is logical as the smooth splines will imperfectly represent the sharp change. The code for this question is in the file named "Q3\_lakeshore\_interp.py".
